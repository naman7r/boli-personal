"""Pedagogy simplification — Hindi in, simpler Hindi out.

One LLM call. It runs *before* translation, and it is the step that
makes the Santali output usable: IndicTrans2 leaks another script when a
word falls outside its training distribution, so replacing textbook
vocabulary with words a Jharkhand child actually uses is not just a
readability win, it is what keeps the translation clean (PRD.md §5).

Prompts live here as named constants, never inline in a route file, so
changing one is a one-line diff in one place (RULES.md §3).

Two providers are supported, chosen by LLM_PROVIDER:

  gemini             Google's REST API, keyed by LLM_API_KEY.
  openai_compatible  Any OpenAI-shaped /chat/completions endpoint, via
                     the openai SDK pointed at LLM_BASE_URL, with the
                     model slug in LLM_MODEL.

Both return the same shape, and the readability numbers are measured
here either way rather than asked of the model.

This does NOT translate. Hindi goes in and Hindi comes out; the
honesty boundary in PRD.md §4 is untouched by anything in this file.

{grade_instruction}
Hindi is the language of the
textbook, but it is NOT most of these children's mother tongue — they speak
Ho, Mundari, Kurukh, Sadri or Santali at home. The teacher needs the lesson
rewritten in Hindi that these children can actually follow.

Rewrite the sentence below. Keep it in Hindi. Apply all three of these:

1. VOCABULARY CONTROL — use everyday spoken words a village child already
   knows. Drop formal, literary or Sanskritised textbook words.
2. CULTURAL SUBSTITUTION — replace things outside a Jharkhand child's
   experience with local equivalents they see every day. For example, crops
   not grown in Jharkhand, unfamiliar city objects, or festivals from
   elsewhere. Keep the lesson's meaning; change the example.
3. SENTENCE SPLITTING — break long sentences into several short ones. Aim
   for sentence lengths matching this grade level. One idea per sentence.

Return JSON only:
- "concept": one short sentence, in English, naming the idea the lesson is
  actually teaching. This is for the teacher, not the child.
- "adapted_hindi": array of short Hindi sentences replacing the original.
- "substitutions": array of the meaning-level swaps you made, each with
  "from" (original Hindi word), "to" (replacement Hindi word), and "why"
  (short English reason a teacher would accept). Only list real cultural or
  vocabulary swaps. Do not list ordinary rephrasing.
