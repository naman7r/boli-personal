## 1. Problem

Jharkhand primary classrooms teach in Hindi. Most children arrive speaking
a different mother tongue (Ho, Mundari, Kurukh, Sadri, Santali, etc.).
96% of Jharkhand's children speak an indigenous language at home
(M-TALL / UNICEF survey). Comprehension failure, not ability, is the
primary driver of early dropout — roughly half of Adivasi children are
gone by Class 5.

No commercial tool addresses this. Google Translate's tribal-language
coverage is near-zero, and where it exists (Santali) it is text-only —
no speech output at all. See `/docs/research/google-gap.md` (screenshots
from SIH deck) for evidence.

## 2. Who this is for

**Primary user: the classroom teacher.** One teacher, one Hindi textbook,
up to four different mother tongues in the room, ~35 minutes per period.
They are not a technical user — assume low smartphone literacy, assume
they will use this standing at the front of a classroom, not sitting at
a desk.

**Secondary user (future, not in hackathon scope): the child.** Today's
build outputs audio and text; direct child interaction is a v2 concern.

## 3. What we are building (hackathon scope)

A web app with three screens and one backend, wrapping the models we
have already validated (see `/docs/research/`):

1. **Input** — teacher types or photographs a Hindi lesson sentence.
2. **Language select** — pick which mother tongues are needed.
3. **Output** — simplified text, arbitrary multi-sentence translation across all 5 target languages (Neural MT for Santali and Kurukh; Linguistic Transfer for Ho and Mundari; Morphological Transfer for Sadri), and spoken audio across all 5 dialects. Downloadable/printable worksheet.

Plus a lightweight **teacher correction log** — not live retraining,
just a record that the correction loop is architected in.

> **Known gap, do not overstate this one.** The log is written to a
> local SQLite file, and the deployment target — a free Hugging Face
> Space — has ephemeral storage. **Corrections do not survive a restart,
> so the log is not actually durable today**, and the "N corrections
> collected" counter resets with it. Until that is fixed, do not
> describe this as a durable or growing record anywhere in the UI, the
> deck, or a judge answer. The intended fix is to write corrections to a
> Hugging Face Dataset repo instead of a local file — free, genuinely
> persistent, and a better match for the "corpus we are building" story
> than a file that disappears. Tracked in PLAN.md Phase 11 and STATE.md;
> not built.

## 4. Multi-Engine Translation Architecture & Scope Boundaries

**Working translation pipelines and speech synthesis:**
- **Santali**: Neural MT using IndicTrans2 (Ol Chiki script) paired with AI4Bharat Indic Parler-TTS voice synthesis.
- **Kurukh**: Neural MT using fine-tuned mT5 (`ankitklakra/hindi-to-kurukh`) paired with Meta MMS-TTS.
- **Ho**: AI-assisted linguistic transfer engine (dedicated lexical substitution and grammatical rules) + Meta MMS-TTS (via Devanagari → Odia transliteration).
- **Mundari**: AI-assisted linguistic transfer engine (Mundari-specific mapping and JCERT vocabulary) + Meta MMS-TTS.
- **Sadri**: Morphological/rule-based transfer engine + Meta MMS-TTS.
- **Pedagogy simplification step** (LLM call): vocabulary control + cultural substitution + sentence splitting, Hindi → Hindi, before translation.
- **Arbitrary multi-sentence support**: Working translation pipeline supports multi-sentence textbook text into all 5 languages.
- **Curated phrase bank**: Maintained as an offline, verified fallback and shortcut.

**Scientific honesty and validation boundary:**
- Translation quality remains subject to field validation by native speakers. BOLI clearly distinguishes between Neural MT, Linguistic Transfer, and Morphological Transfer in all UI labels and documentation.

**Not in hackathon scope at all:**
- Native mobile app (React Native is the *stated future* architecture,
  not built now — see ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Offline/on-device model execution
- Live model retraining from corrections (log only, for now)
- Any claim of native-speaker-verified translation accuracy — this is
  explicitly pending; do not remove or soften "pending validation"
  language anywhere in the UI or docs.

## 5. Success criteria for the hackathon build

- A teacher can go from "typed/photographed Hindi sentence" to
  "playable audio in a target language" in under 15 seconds, no errors,
  on a phone browser.
- Santali path shows the pedagogy fix live: an unmodified textbook
  sentence produces visibly broken output (Meetei Mayek script
  contamination); an adapted sentence built from in-domain vocabulary
  produces clean Ol Chiki. This contrast must be reproducible on
  demand, not just in a screenshot.

  **What actually drives the contrast is vocabulary, not sentence
  length.** IndicTrans2 leaks another Indic script when a word falls
  outside its Santali training distribution, and shortening a sentence
  does not by itself fix that. Verified through the live API on
  2026-09-05:

  | Hindi in | Santali out | Clean? |
  |---|---|---|
  | किसान खेत में गेहूँ उगाता है और उसे बाज़ार में बेचता है। | `... ᱨᱮ ꯒꯦꯍꯨ ᱡᱟᱱᱟᱢᱼᱟ ...` | no — गेहूँ → Meetei Mayek |
  | किसान खेत में धान उगाता है। | `... ᱨᱮ ꯆꯦꯡ ᱠᱚ ᱡᱟᱱᱟᱢᱼᱟ ᱾` | no — धान → Meetei Mayek |
  | धान हाट में बिकता है। | `ᱦᱟᱛ ᱨᱮ ᱫᱟᱠᱟ ᱟᱹᱠᱷᱨᱤᱧ ᱦᱩᱭᱩᱜᱼᱟ ᱾` | yes |
  | किसान पैसे कमाता है। | `ᱪᱟᱥᱤᱭᱟᱹ ᱠᱚ ᱠᱟᱹᱣᱰᱤ ᱠᱚ ᱟᱨᱡᱟᱣᱼᱟ ᱾` | yes |

  Note rows 2 and 3: **the same word, धान, leaks in one sentence and
  translates cleanly in another.** So this is not a per-word blacklist
  that can be computed — it is context-dependent, and any sentence used
  as the "clean" half of a demo has to be checked against the live API
  rather than assumed. The canonical clean example is
  `धान हाट में बिकता है।`. `किसान खेत में धान उगाता है।` is **not** a
  clean example, despite being short and adapted.
- Every screen states clearly what is real translation vs. curated
  phrase bank. No overclaiming, anywhere, ever.
- Deployed to a permanent public URL (not a Colab-dependent tunnel).

## 6. Non-goals (say no to these if asked mid-build)

- Do not add more languages "for coverage" without a working model
  behind them — a fake language in a dropdown is worse than an honest
  gap.
- Do not build user accounts / auth for the hackathon version.
- Do not attempt to fine-tune any model during the hackathon window —
  every model used is a pretrained, open checkpoint, used as-is.
